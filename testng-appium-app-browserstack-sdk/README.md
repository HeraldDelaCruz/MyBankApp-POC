## Getting Started

Getting Started with Appium tests in TestNg on BrowserStack couldn't be easier!

### **Run Sample test :**

- Switch to one of the following directories: [Android examples](android/testng-examples) or [iOS examples](ios/testng-examples)
- Run the following maven command `mvn test -P sample-test`

### **Use Local testing for apps that access resources hosted in development or testing environments :**

- Simply configure the `browserstackLocal` parameter in the `browserstack.yml` file accordingly in [Android examples](android/testng-examples) or [iOS examples](ios/testng-examples).
  ```
  browserstackLocal: true
  ```
- You can use the `LocalSample` app provided in both folder [Android examples](android/testng-examples) or [iOS examples](ios/testng-examples) to run your test. Change the app parameter in the `browserstack.yml` file and run the tests with the following command: `mvn test -P sample-local-test`
